    <p>
        The Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ is not meant to burden hearts, but to heal them. <br>
        It is a living example of kindness, patience, humility, and mercy — shown through everyday actions, gentle words, and deep understanding of human nature. The Prophet ﷺ met people where they were, uplifted them without humiliation, and guided them with wisdom and compassion. <br>
        In this space, the Sunnah is explored not as a list of expectations, but as a source of comfort and direction — offering guidance for relationships, personal struggles, and moments of doubt. <br>
<br>
        The Sunnah reminds us that faith is meant to soften us, not harden us — and to bring light into our lives, not heaviness.
